üöó Automobile Service and Maintenance Tracking 

Industry: Automobile

üìå Project Overview
This project involved designing a comprehensive database system to track vehicle service history, parts inventory, mechanic performance and customer satisfaction for Elegant automobile service center. The system was built using SQL for database design and Power BI for analytics and reporting. Key components include:

‚Ä¢	üóÉÔ∏è Database Design: Created relational tables (Vehicles, Service_Records, Mechanics, Parts_Inventory, Service_Types, Customers, Feedbacks) with proper schema relationships.
‚Ä¢	‚å®Ô∏è Manual Data Entry: Populated tables with realistic service records, parts usage and customer feedback.
‚Ä¢	üìä Power BI Reporting: Developed interactive dashboards to analyze maintenance trends, parts inventory, mechanic efficiency and customer satisfaction.
‚Ä¢	üî¢ DAX Measures & Calculated Columns: Implemented advanced calculations to derive insights on service frequency, mechanic performance and inventory management.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary objective was to optimize service center operations by:
‚Ä¢	Tracking vehicle maintenance history to predict service needs.
‚Ä¢	Managing parts inventory efficiently with automated reorder alerts.
‚Ä¢	Evaluating mechanic performance based on service quality and efficiency.
‚Ä¢	Analyzing customer feedback to improve service satisfaction.

üìä Dashboard
The dashboard was created using Power Bi



üìä Key Metrics Analyzed
1.	Service Frequency:
‚Ä¢	Most common service types (e.g., oil changes, brake inspections).
‚Ä¢	Vehicles requiring frequent maintenance.
2.	Parts Inventory Management:
‚Ä¢	High-demand parts vs. low-stock items.
‚Ä¢	Reorder alerts for critical parts.
3.	Mechanic Performance:
‚Ä¢	Service completion time vs. customer ratings.
‚Ä¢	Top-performing mechanics based on efficiency and feedback.
4.	Customer Satisfaction:
‚Ä¢	Average feedback ratings correlated with service types.
‚Ä¢	Trends in customer complaints vs. service quality.

üõ†Ô∏è Insights & Findings

1. Service Frequency Analysis
‚Ä¢	Most Common Services: Oil changes (Service Type 1) and brake inspections (Service Type 2) were the most frequently performed.
‚Ä¢	High-Maintenance Vehicles: Toyota Camry (Vehicle_ID 1) and Honda Accord (Vehicle_ID 2) required the most frequent servicing.

2. Parts Inventory Insights
‚Ä¢	High-Demand Parts: Oil filters (Part_ID 1) and brake pads (Part_ID 2) were the most frequently used.
‚Ä¢	‚ö†Low-Stock Alerts: Battery (Part_ID 3) and timing belts (Part_ID 10) needed replenishment.

3. Mechanic Performance Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Top Mechanic: Udom (Mechanic_ID 1) had the highest efficiency (fastest service times) and best customer ratings (avg. 4.8/5).
‚Ä¢	Areas for Improvement: Some mechanics (e.g., Johnson, Mechanic_ID 3) had longer service times but maintained good ratings.

4. Customer Satisfaction Trends
‚Ä¢	Highest Satisfaction: Services like oil changes and battery replacements received the best ratings (avg. 4.5/5).
‚Ä¢	Lowest Satisfaction: Brake inspections had slightly lower ratings (avg. 3.8/5), possibly due to longer wait times.

üí° Business Recommendations

1.	Optimize Inventory Management:
‚Ä¢		Automate reorder alerts for high-demand parts (oil filters, brake pads).
‚Ä¢	  Negotiate bulk discounts with suppliers for frequently used items.

2.	Improve Mechanic Efficiency:
‚Ä¢	 Provide additional training for mechanics with slower service times.
‚Ä¢	Incentivize top performers (e.g. Udom) to maintain high standards.

3.	Enhance Customer Experience:
‚Ä¢	‚è±Reduce wait times for brake inspections by allocating more mechanics.
‚Ä¢	Implement a feedback follow-up system to address complaints proactively.

4.	Predictive Maintenance Strategy:
‚Ä¢	Use historical data to schedule preventive maintenance for high-usage vehicles.
‚Ä¢	Offer service packages for frequent customers to improve retention.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully transformed raw service data into actionable insights using SQL and Power BI. By tracking maintenance trends, optimizing parts inventory and evaluating mechanic performance, the automobile service center can enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Future enhancements could include integrating real-time IoT sensors for vehicle diagnostics and AI-driven predictive maintenance.
